-- 0102_employer_contributions_all_retirement.sql
--
-- Everything an employer's contribution settings fund goes to the member's
-- RETIREMENT pot. Nobody is asked to split it.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG. A member invited by their employer finished KYC on a screen
-- titled "Split your savings", which asked them to choose a retirement / liquid
-- percentage. Under the unified two-leg model (0092/0093) that member states no
-- amount at all — the employer's config sets BOTH legs and their own schedule
-- amount is written as 0 — so the split was the only thing the screen collected,
-- and the only money it could act on was their employer's. The question read as
-- a personal preference and functioned as a withdrawal tap on someone else's
-- pension contribution: at the maximum liquid setting 40% of every payroll
-- deduction and every company top-up landed in a pot the member can empty at any
-- time. It also applied to the employee leg, which is nominally the member's own
-- money but whose RATE the employer sets and whose deduction happens in payroll
-- — so it was never theirs to allocate either.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES.
--   (1) submit_employer_contribution_run — both pension legs post
--       split_retirement = the full leg, split_emergency = 0. The per-member
--       retirement_pct read (and the contribution_schedules join that existed
--       only to fetch it) is gone.
--   (2) create_subscriber_from_employer_invite — a newly created member's own
--       schedule is written at the standard 80/20 default with amount 0, and any
--       split still carried in the signup payload is ignored (the invite UI no
--       longer collects one, so a value there can only come from a stale client).
--
-- THE TWO ARE NOW FULLY DECOUPLED, which is the point of this migration:
--
--   employer legs          → posted by contribution runs, 100% retirement, fixed
--                            in the run engine, unaffected by anything the member
--                            sets, and never routed through a schedule row.
--   contribution_schedules → the MEMBER's own plan. Their amount, their split,
--                            default 80/20, theirs to change to 60/40 or 100/0 or
--                            anything else. Governs only money they put in
--                            themselves: the scheduled contribution and Save-page
--                            top-ups (make_contribution, 0054, takes the pct from
--                            this row via the client).
--
-- So `retirement_pct` is NOT retired and NOT pinned. It simply stopped deciding
-- where somebody else's money goes. Note the previous revision of this migration
-- stamped 100/0 here — that quietly pre-decided the member's own split from the
-- employer's allocation, which is the same coupling in the opposite direction.
--
-- NOT TOUCHED, deliberately:
--   * Existing transactions keep the splits they were posted with. Those runs
--     really did allocate that way; rewriting them would falsify the ledger and
--     desync subscriber_balances, which the 0016 trigger maintains from these
--     rows. Members keep whatever liquid balance they have already accrued.
--   * Existing members' schedule rows. They are the members' own settings; this
--     migration has no business rewriting them, and doing so would redirect their
--     voluntary top-ups. Branch (a) of the invite RPC — an existing subscriber
--     being re-tagged to an employer — is left alone for the same reason: they
--     may already have a schedule they chose.
--   * Self-signup (create_subscriber_from_signup) and the agent onboarding path.
--     Those members fund themselves, so the split is genuinely theirs.
--
-- PARITY: src/utils/contributionModel.js (EMPLOYER_FUNDED_SPLIT +
-- splitEmployerLeg) and src/services/employer.js (_mockSubmitEmployerRun) carry
-- the same allocation for the offline path. Guarded by
-- src/utils/__tests__/employer-funded-split.test.js, which greps this file.
