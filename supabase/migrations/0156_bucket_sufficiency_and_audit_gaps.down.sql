-- ⚠️ REINSTATES A PHANTOM-MONEY PATH. Read 0156's header.
--
-- Restoring the engine's total-units-only D8 check means a per-bucket shortfall
-- is absorbed by the GREATEST(0, ...) clamps again: on a price fall between
-- request and dealing date, total_balance drops by only what the pot held while
-- units drop in full, leaving the member carrying value no units back. Measured
-- at 95,411 UGX on a single redemption.
--
-- It also puts back the synchronous withdrawal that records no unit movement
-- (so reverse_transaction refuses every one), and nav_missing_days' status
-- column that can only ever say 'unpriced'.
